# CD39 cooperates with CD73 to promote pancreatic cancer


Abstract


The ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 promote tumor immune escape by catalyzing extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to immunosuppressive adenosine (ADO); and as such represent potential cancer targets. We investigated biological impacts of CD39 and CD73 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by studying clinical samples and experimental mouse tumors. Stromal CD39 and tumoral CD73 expression were significantly associated with worse PDAC survival and abolished the favorable prognostic impact associated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating CD8 cells. In transplanted KPC tumors, both CD39 and CD73 on myeloid cells and CD73 on tumor cells promoted polarization of infiltrating myeloid cells towards an M2-like phenotype and enhanced tumor growth. Furthermore, CD39 on tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and pancreatic stellate cells suppressed IFN-ÔÅß production by T cells. While therapeutic inhibition of CD39 or CD73 alone significantly delayed tumor growth in vivo, targeting of both ectonucleotidases exhibited markedly superior anti-tumor activity. Intriguingly, CD73 expression on human and mouse PDAC tumor cells protected against DNA damage in a cell-autonomous manner, and large-scale pharmacogenomic analyses of human PDAC cell lines revealed strong associations between CD73 expression and gemcitabine chemoresistance. Strikingly, increased DNA damage in CD73-deficient tumor cells was associated with activation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Moreover, cGAS expression in mouse KPC tumor cells was required for anti-tumor activity of the CD73 inhibitor AB680 in vivo. Our study thus illuminates molecular mechanisms whereby CD73 and CD39 seemingly cooperate to promote PDAC progression.
